# Hello Phosphor

Phosphor is an _application framework_ for the web. It provides a 
message-passing component framework, plugin management, layouts, a command
processor (with keyboard shortcuts and context menus!), and various utilities to
make it all tick. Phosphor is modular, and integrates with your favorite
front-end framework; you can use as much or as little of it as you like.
    
## The Web of Applications

The modern web is not designed for applications. It was built from the beginning
for documents, and that won't change anytime soon. But increasingly, we see the
web not just as a network of documents, but as a secure container for running
desktop apps. Phosphor helps bridge the gap between documents and applications
by taking care of the myriad shortcomings in the document approach, while
maintaining the flexibility and agility that the web is known for.
